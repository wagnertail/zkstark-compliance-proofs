# Composable zk-STARK Compliance Proofs with Third-Party Accountability

**Working Draft ‚Äì Cryptographic Compliance Model (zk-STARKs)**  
**Version:** v1.1  
**Author:** Adam Dickson  
**Date:** 11 June 2025

This repository outlines a modular zk-STARK-based system for verifiable legal and regulatory compliance without exposing or storing sensitive documents. It is part of ongoing independent research into cryptographic attestation models that prioritize auditability, privacy, and accountability.

## Objective

To enable trusted verification of sensitive regulatory or legal documents without exposing or storing them, and to assign clear responsibility for validation and compliance ‚Äî using modular zero-knowledge proofs (zk-STARKs).

## Core Idea

This system uses a two-stage proof process:

1. **Verifier attestation:**  
   A verifier (e.g. regulator, lawyer, or approved regtech) reviews a sensitive document and issues a zk-STARK proving that it meets predefined criteria.

2. **User final proof:**  
   The user generates a second zk-STARK proof using:
   - The same document (privately held)
   - A compliance template that encodes required logic or conditions (e.g. field presence, format, thresholds) ‚Äî forming the zk circuit
   - The verifier‚Äôs attestation proof
   - A unique, private salt to anchor both proofs to the same document hash

The final proof confirms that:
- The verifier reviewed and approved the document
- The document satisfies compliance conditions
- No sensitive data is exposed at any stage

## Accountability

Both verifier and user are bound to the same document via a hashed commitment.  
In case of a dispute:
- An invalid verifier attestation ‚Üí verifier proof fails
- A modified document or template ‚Üí user proof fails

This ensures cryptographic accountability for both parties without requiring signatures, keys, or blockchain anchoring.

## Case Study: Legal or Regulatory Filing

Replaces traditional workflows (email threads, drive uploads) with:
- Private review by verifier
- zk-STARK proof of compliance by user
- Public verifiability ‚Äî no access to the original document required

## Key Differentiators

- ‚úÖ Independent accountability for verifier and submitter  
- üîê Tamper-proof, reproducible audit trail  
- üïµÔ∏è Zero exposure of sensitive content  
- üîÑ Modular, composable proof design  
- üìé Real-world process alignment (not just crypto-native logic)  
- üß¨ Native post-quantum security with no trusted setup
